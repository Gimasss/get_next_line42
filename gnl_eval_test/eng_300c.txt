Disguised as a cotton ball, he infiltrated the guinea pig fortress. However, the cunning guinea pigs were onto him. 
As Fluffy made his getaway, a squad of guinea pigs shouted, "Halt! We've got you surrounded!" Fluffy, panicking, yelled, "It's just a bad hair day!"
The guinea pigs exchanged puzzled glances, then burst into laughter. "A bad hair day, you say? Well, carry on then! We've all been there!"
Amidst the laughter, Fluffy rolled away to hamster victory, leaving the guinea pigs in stitches.
